# ACM_Website
All the images are present in 'skins' folder.

Folders for respective file classes have been made.

Prefer to write the whole css in a single file.

For all the pages, use the % sizes as in home.html . They have been calculated very precisely and carefully.

The XD file for the project is in the designs folder.
